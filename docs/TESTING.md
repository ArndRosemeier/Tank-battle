# Testing — what proves this

This doc records the **pins** and what was **actually executed**. "It compiles" is
never "it passed".

## The pin matrix

| Behaviour | Pin (test) | Where | How it is watched red |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| One slice per whole step, remainder kept for `alpha` | `runs one slice per whole step and keeps the remainder` | `src/core/timestep.test.ts` | drop the accumulator decrement → no steps run |
| A 60 Hz stream runs exactly 60 slices (no slow clock) | `runs exactly 60 slices for 60 frames of one 60 Hz slice, so the clock cannot drift` | `src/core/timestep.test.ts` | remove the tolerance while keeping a 1/60 step → 59 steps |
| A long frame is credited at most `maxFrame` (no spiral) | `credits a long frame as at most maxFrame, so the simulation cannot spiral` | `src/core/timestep.test.ts` | remove `Math.min` (arm C) or the tolerance (arm B) → 1000, resp. 24 |
| A zero-length frame never steps | `runs no slice for a zero-length frame` | `src/core/timestep.test.ts` | step before adding the frame time |
| `reset()` drops the remainder | `drops the sub-step remainder on reset` | `src/core/timestep.test.ts` | make `reset()` a no-op |
| A negative or non-finite frame delta throws | `rejects a frame time that is negative or not finite` | `src/core/timestep.test.ts` | drop the `< 0` half of the guard (arm D) |
| A non-positive step, or `maxFrame < step`, throws | `rejects a step that is not positive, or a maxFrame below the step` | `src/core/timestep.test.ts` | drop either constructor guard |
| The defaults are 60 Hz with a 0.25 s clamp | `defaults to a 60 Hz slice with a quarter-second clamp` | `src/core/timestep.test.ts` | change either default constant |

The differential harness is a local artifact at `.gate-logs/differential.sh`
(gitignored; the mutations are described in the table below, so it can be rebuilt).

`src/entry/dom.ts` is deliberately unpinned: it is thin DOM glue whose failure mode is
a throw on a missing node, and proving it needs a browser. The seam index records it
as known debt ([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) §4).

## Raw logs

The gate writes `.gate-logs/gate.log`; the differential writes
`.gate-logs/arm-<name>.log`. Both are gitignored and kept until a landing is verified.
Never pipe a run through `tail`/`head` — it destroys the failing evidence and returns
the pipeline's last status.

## Per landing

### row 0 — day-1 bootstrap (scaffold, gate, canvas skeleton)

- **Gate:** cheap tier `pnpm run build` GREEN, exit `2` (the suite did NOT run — this
  is not "the gate passed"). Full gate GREEN, exit `0` · `8/8` tests · vitest 5.0.5,
  226 ms · raw `.gate-logs/gate.log`.
- **First run was RED** — and that is recorded, not hidden: the clamp pin failed with
  `expected 24 to be 25`, which is how the float-drift defect was found
  (ledger row 4). Fixed forward, then re-gated.
- **Differential** (`.gate-logs/differential.sh`, lock held, restored in a `trap`,
  restore hash verified):

  | arm | `src/core/timestep.ts` sha256 | result |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | A baseline | `e52d62cd281bac2b7e6e1f0046d988e48036d60d8ca441c5f908999033adcae0` | 8/8 green |
  | B no tolerance | `ef5a765359bea705fbce44f92388b2b1c16e6f73fa8085a0ceda3c3be9033313` | RED on `credits a long frame as at most maxFrame …` |
  | C no clamp | `33e50a4e0f92c0704af4f5f84a76b3dabb2fd9cc9735f03d51dd401cba3869a3` | RED on the same pin |
  | D no negative guard | `986d8409a17d7d6b05aaa45dd317d27b45c7f429abe77e307044035ae82768d8` | RED on `rejects a frame time that is negative or not finite` |

- **Honest observation:** arms B and C red the *same* pin. That pin is the one that
  asserts the exact slice count, so it holds both the clamp and the tolerance; the
  60 Hz drift pin stayed green under arm B, so it alone would **not** have caught the
  drift bug. Two properties, one pin — acceptable while the count assertion is the
  stronger statement, and worth splitting if a third property lands on it.
- **VOID probes:** none.
- **Not run:** no real-browser pin, no publish. Both are deliberate (board rows 1–2).

## Honest records

A VOID probe, a wrong-file green, a discarded log and a run against a stale tree are
**recorded, not hidden**. An honest unknown is worth more than a confident green.
